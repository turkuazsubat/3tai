# 3tai

## Project Overview  
3tai is an AI-powered version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It offers a user-friendly interface and a challenging single-player experience powered by a robust artificial intelligence. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make strategic moves against the player.

## How It Works  
Players and the AI take turns placing their marks on a 3x3 board. The goal is to align three identical symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The AI evaluates all possible moves using the Minimax algorithm to choose the most advantageous play, providing a competitive challenge.

## AI Techniques Used  
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Explores game scenarios deeply to select the optimal move.  
- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Scores board states to optimize decision-making.  
- **Random Move (Easy Mode):** Introduces randomness to allow easier wins for beginners.

## Role of AI in the Project  
In single-player mode, after the playerâ€™s move, the AI analyzes the board and uses optimization strategies to select the best possible move, making the gameplay realistic and engaging.
